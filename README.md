# AtliQ-Mart-Supply-Chain-Dashboard
This project aims to track and analyze the service levels for customer deliveries at AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer in Gujarat, India. The dashboard created in Power BI helps the company monitor and respond to delivery service issues (on-time and in-full delivery) to improve customer satisfaction before expanding to other cities.
