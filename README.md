# AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Dashboard

## Overview

This project aims to track and analyze the service levels for customer deliveries at AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer in Gujarat, India. The dashboard created in Power BI helps the company monitor and respond to delivery service issues (on-time and in-full delivery) to improve customer satisfaction before expanding to other cities.

## Metrics Tracked

1. **On-Time Delivery (OT) %**: Measures the percentage of customer orders delivered on time.
2. **In-Full Delivery (IF) %**: Measures the percentage of customer orders delivered in full.
3. **On-Time In Full (OTIF) %**: Measures the percentage of customer orders that are both on-time and in-full.

## Purpose

The dashboard is designed to help the Supply Chain team monitor these service metrics on a daily basis and take corrective actions when necessary to improve service levels and ensure customer retention.
